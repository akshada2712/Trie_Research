# Trie Implementation in Python
## Overview
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Trie data structure, a game-changing approach to string manipulation. Unlike traditional methods, Trie offers unparalleled efficiency in storing and searching strings.


trie_data.py: Contains the implementation of the Trie data structure and testing on various strings.

## Visualizations
Visualizations showcasing the performance of Trie compared to Python's inbuilt modules for string manipulation tasks can be found in the visualizations directory.

The visualizations depict that using a Trie data structure to search for prefix words is faster than using Python modules, especially as the number of words increases.
